```{r data input}
dataset1 <- read_csv("raw data/Paperid_Remoteness_Authors_Teamroles.csv")
city_latlong <- read_csv("raw data/ScienceCityLatLong.csv")
paperid_year <- read_delim("raw data/Paperid_Year_Discipline_Teamsize_Distance_Dscore.txt", col_names = c("Paperid","Year","Discipline","Teamsize","Distance","Dscore"), delim = "\t")

## Prepare data

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r data reshaping}
connection_data <- dataset2 %>% 
  unite(D_score,c("D_score1","D_score2"),sep = ",")

science_and_engineering = c("geology","medicine","mathematics","physics","materials science",
                            "biology","chemistry","engineering","computer science","geography",
                            "environmental science")
social_sciences <- c("political science","business","economics","psychology","sociology")
art_and_humanity <- c("history","art","philosophy")

df <- bind_rows(
  data.frame(Discipline = science_and_engineering, fields = "science_and_engineering"),
  data.frame(Discipline = social_sciences, fields = "social_sciences"),
  data.frame(Discipline = art_and_humanity, fields = "art_and_humanity")
)

paperid_year <- left_join(paperid_year, df, by = "Discipline")

  [1,2,4,5,6,7,9,10,14,15,18] ## 
SS = [0,8,11,16,17]## 
AH = [3,12,13]## art and humanity
```

```{r top1%}

top_paper <- paperid_year %>% 
  filter(Dscore > 0.2)


ds_hist <- ggplot(top_paper, aes(x = Dscore))
ds_hist + geom_histogram()

ds_n0_hist <- ggplot(top_paper %>% filter(Distance > 0), aes(x = Dscore))
ds_n0_hist + geom_histogram()

di_hist <- ggplot(top_paper, aes(x = Distance))
di_hist + geom_histogram()

di_n0_hist <- ggplot(top_paper %>% filter(Distance > 0), aes(x = Distance))
di_n0_hist + geom_histogram()

d_d <- ggplot(top_paper, aes(x = Distance, y = Dscore, color = Year)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
#  geom_scattermore() # otherwise, it can take forever
ggMarginal(d_d, type = "histogram")

d_d_n0 <- ggplot(top_paper %>% filter(Distance > 0), aes(x = Distance, y = Dscore, color = Year, shape = fields)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1)
#  geom_scattermore() # otherwise, it can take forever
ggMarginal(d_d_n0, type = "histogram")

d_d_n0_log <- d_d_n0 + scale_x_continuous(trans = 'log10') + # Log scale for x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(trans = 'log10') # Log scale for y-axis
ggMarginal(d_d_n0_log, type = "histogram")
```
```{r distribution of Dscore in local}
Locol_data <- paperid_year %>% 
  filter(Distance == 0)
ds_hist_l <- ggplot(Locol_data, aes(x = Dscore))
ds_hist_l + geom_density()
```
That is a Laplace distribution
