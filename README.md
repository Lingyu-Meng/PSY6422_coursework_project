# Conclusion and Significance

1.  By looking at the ignored data, we found an opposite result to the original paper using the same data set. This finding indicates the importance of describing the analysis process in detail and sharing the data.

2.  Instead of supposing selection bias, we confirmed that the missing data is related to the distance between collaborators. This finding indicates that it is true that on-site collaboration yields more uncitable papers, and this ignored result may affect the result of the original paper.

3.  Don't be afraid of remote collaboration. The data shows strong evidence that the remote collaboration is good for the scientific community, as the original paper shows that it is bad, and we did find a time effect for getting a better result.
